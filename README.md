Project:

This is a fully operating chat system like whatsapp or wechat, which contains practically all possible chatting functions with some modifications,
e.g. there is a possibility to call and read some sonnets etc.

Also, besides the main things, the program has some great extensions; first of all it must be mentioned that our project has cat-related thematics 
because, while studying remotely all of us, we found some interesting and unique connection between people on a distance: kittens; kittens are
some "medicaments" for people who miss others :)

Program's extension includes GUI, Public Key Encryption, Tic-Tac-Toe 2-player game and AI-based Checkers game (1-player, implemented Minimax Algorithm)
